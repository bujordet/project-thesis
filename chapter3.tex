\section{CASE: The Life Science Building-project}
The project case will examine the construction of the new life science building of the University of Oslo. When finished, the building will reach a cost of approximately 6,8 million Norwegian Kroner (NOK), and cover 66,700 square meters, with this, becoming the most extensive, detached university building in Norway. Construction builder is the Norwegian Directorate of Public Construction and Property Management (Statsbygg). The construction started on the 8 of February 2019 and is expected to finish in 2024, while the project management of this report started in 2017.

The builder, Stasbygg, is a significant organization in the Norwegian construction industry. They are on a state mission, which means that they are to realize the politics decided by the government, achieved in architecture, cultural legacy, spatial planning, and environment. 

Each year, Statsbygg constructs about 100 construction projects. Some are more complex than others. The life science Building is one of the more complex. In addition to the construction of new buildings and projects, Statsbygg managing about 600 properties of these 90 outside of Norway. Examples of properties managed by Statsbygg are embassies, royal properties, colleges, and cultural buildings. 

In regards to complexity, the new life science building has to meet several complex requirements: (1) the environmental: The property is to achieve Excellent in the BREEAM NOR classification of sustainable properties; (2) usability: a group of the final users has given their feedback on what they expect from the final building; and (3) technical requirements: The building is to house several faculties, some requires highly technical labs.

\subsection*{Project vision}
The construction of the new Life Science Building is, in many ways, a prestige project. The project is following in the line of previous two large projects running Lean Construction, with Statsbygg as manager. Starting with the Domus Medica construction concluded in 2013. This project was the first Norwegian group applying Lean. This construction was followed by the raising of the new Bergen Academy of Art and Design (BAAD). During these projects, Lean Construction was a significant part of the project management. The first project suffered substantial scope creep, which made the managers take action, applying Lean Design and Automated Completion \textit{Automatisk Ferdigstillelse} on the BAAD-project. The moves made gave results, and when finished in 2017, the project was by many considered one the most successful construction ever. 

With the previous history and knowledge of earlier projects, Stasbygg, as a manager, defined four superior strategies in the upcoming LSB-project: Systematic completion, Lean, Digitalization, and Logistics. These strategies affect how the project should run and emphasize the focus of the project managers, hopefully leading to a sustainable and productive project. 

\subsection*{Contract models used in the project}
The project has made use of a customized version of the Shared Contract. Instead of signing single contracts with each subcontractor, the managers have assembled eight arrangements, each covering different divisions of the project. Hereunder a more Lead Contract type is applied. Figure \ref{fig:project_contracts} displays the eight contract divisions. Responsible for each of the contracts, from management, is either the project manager from construction or technical. 

The motivation for this model is, first, shielding the contractors from some of the risk running this project. The project is, as mentioned, very intricate in construction, as well as in management. Moreover, getting contractors willing to apply on this project, the managers will take much of the risk. Measures were taken, regarding cooperation, appling Lead Contracts. The intention of this is cooperation; besides, sharing a contract has the plan of shared responsibility and incentives for collaboration between subcontractors. Even though there is a lead contractor per division, the hope is that the group of subcontractors should feel shared responsibility. Why not have a shared responsibility, and no leading contractor, one may ask? The answer is partly laws and politics, but moreover for simplicity in regards to management.

\subsection*{Project management in the Life Science Building-project}
To manage a project, this significant, the constructing organization makes use of several different management approaches. One can divide the project management into two levels: (1) process management: The support of the process and how the teams are working together, and in what order; and (2) implementation management: The management of design and implementation of the final product. The organization structure used in the project supports the two levels of project management. The first of the two, process management, are using customized sprint-based process management, adopted from agile construction. Implementation management using a four-level goal- and tactic-based management.  

The construction project organization structure, as seen in figure \ref{fig:project_structure}. Starting at the top, in charge of the project,is the project director, supported by assisting project director. The board, seen on the right, consists of four managers, each responsible for different strategies of the project. On the left HSE and project support, which is responsible for i.a. communication, economics, progress. Beneath the four divisions in the project, where design is responsible for process and management and paraphernalia for what items should be placed in the final building. Construction and technical are two divisions responsible for 8 contracts.

Making sure the resulting building is a correct representation of the project vision, process management has developed a customized process. Influenced by agile processes, the method using an iterative process, starting with the vision of the building, ending up with the product; in the form of a finished building. Every iteration has the intention of getting closer to the conclusion, not concluding too early. When every discipline is taken into consideration and satisfied, the project proceeds into the next iteration. Hopefully, this makes for nothing to be redone because no crucial parts are missing. Having these iterations depends on involving disciplines and actors early in the process, which is shown to be demanding.

The implementation management divides into four levels: (1) the Milestones: A significant planned completion of a part of the project, e.g., completion of a floor or start of a new project phase; (2) Key Points: Key Points is less significant, and with a shorter time frame than milestones, but in the same way an indication of completion; (3) Deliveries: Deliveries consists of several Key Points, e.g., finishing a room or design of a floor; and (4) Actions: Actions is everything needed to be done to complete a Delivery. 

\subsubsection{Cooperation in the Life Science Building Project}


\subsubsection{Project management software}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cogito: Planning and getting information about how much can run in parallel and serial. 
    \item Revit and DRofus
    \item Solibri
    \item Interacso
    \item BIM
\end{itemize}
 
\subsubsection{Project management methods} 
Lean Constructing heavily influences project management in the LSB-project. Some ceremonies applied weekly are Weekly Work Plan (WWP). Every Monday, stakeholders are gathered, checking the status of the project. Identifying progress or mostly lack of it, using Cogito. Deliveries or Key Points are highlighted, and issues been raised. Keeping every stakeholder informed about the status of the project.
