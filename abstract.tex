\noindent This project is a case study of the new life science building of the University of Oslo. When finished, the life science building will become Norway's most complex educational building and in the course of the construction employ over 2000 employees. On average, an employee in the construction business conducts 90,4\% productivity, compared to an average of 129,8\% work productivity in all on land work in Norway \cite{ssb_productivity}. The goal of this project is to identify critical factors why there is this considerable gap in labor productivity in the construction business, compared to other on land industries. Not only is the problem of labor productivity, but it also fails to deliver on time, or even deliver at all. A problem that was known to occur in the IT industry. The study conducts an analysis of several topics, which includes working methodology, by some is said to be the critical factor of the rise in productivity and the ability to deliver in IT business. Comparing the use of the methodology in IT and constructing, the project discusses the importance of agile methods to overcome the matter of productivity in the constructing business. Other topics examined is organization structure, and the use of technical tools to streamline productivity and communication in organizations. All these topics will be analyzed first as a litterateur study and then an empirical study, with interviews and observations, of what the employees in The Life Science Project experience concerning the aspects mentioned.
