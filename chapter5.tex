\chapter{Analysis and Discussion}
This chapter tries to analyse and discuss the questions asked in the \nameref{sec:research} section of the introduction. Using knowledge from both the litterature review and the case study, presented in section \ref{sec:analysis}. This analysis will give the foundation for the further work discussed in section \ref{sec:further_work}.
