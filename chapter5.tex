\chapter{Discussion} \label{cha:discussion}
This chapter discuss the questions on the research question, and discuss the results. Using knowledge from both the litterature review and the case study. This discussion will give the foundation for the conclusion and further work discussed in chapter \ref{cha:conclusion}. 

This project thesis tries to identify the fundamental reason for the striking difference in LP between the ICT-industry and CI, in a project utilizing lean methodology and software supporting it. The results indicate that the use of tools as lean and groupware is not as helpful as hoped, due to reduced utilization. The indication for poor LP identified in the LSB-project has a basis in the interaction between the workers, where a lack of understanding and unsure responsibility are a significant impact on the projects productivity. 

This result suggests the reason for the striking difference in LP. This chapter will discuss this result around the three key themes identified in the analysis of the interview data. 

\section{Interaction} \label{sec:dis_interaction}
The interaction in a complex organization, with lots of contractors, causes a challenge for the interaction. A monumental issue is the contracts themself. The entrepreneurs are often less eager to cooperate if this could weaken their contract. Furthermore, the fear of transparency is a true barrier for good cooperation and interaction to happen. This cost of this issues is in line with Zaghoul \cite{zaghloul2003construction}, indicating the increased total cost for the project. Moreover, the contracts are in practice a concern about risk allocation. With the unsure responsibility, investigated further in section \ref{sec:dis_responsibility}, proclaiming an even more significant increase in total cost. 

The vision and strategies are an essential aspect of the management of the organization. The results contradict the claims of Buvik and Rolfsen \cite{rolfsen} that the development of a common philosophy: namely the vision, will aid the trust among team members. The problem in the LSB-project is that the top-down approach heavily influences the management. This gives workers who have little perception of the common philosophy. Furthermore, early and clear role expectations and early development of trust are problematic in a project where there is a high degree of turnover. 

The top-down approach makes for a problematic implementation of a common philosophy, but also the implementation of lean. One of the principles of the agile manifesto \cite{agile_manifesto} states:

\textit{Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.}

This principle is contrary to the top-down approach influencing the project's structure. Also, how the lean is design is supporting the old methods used, and often contrary to the agile manifesto. The use of Gantt-chart is a prime example of this issue. 

When they are applying lean in a top-down manner, it leads to the workers working in the same way as done before. This observation contradicts the claims from Ingvaldsen and Rolsen that the introduction of lean can hamper the Norwegian working model. This contradiction supports the difference between ICT-industry and CI. In the ICT-industry, the workers claim that they are working lean, while in the CI, lean is more a tool for project management.
\section{Lack of understanding} \label{sec:dis_understanding}
Construction engineering is complicated and even more complicating when needing to synchronize with all other disciplines needed to get the building finished. The amount of knowledge needed in this business is immense. It is also wrong to state that the business lacks the understanding of computers and lean methodology, on a general basis. Though, in the LSB-project, there have been identified issues concerning lack of understanding, when introducing the tools used. 

When considering the lean methodology, one might argue that it is not that they do not understand it, but that they will not use it. The reason might be that they have not seen the effect, and while knowing the old methods by heart, it is more natural to use those. 

On the other hand, when using it, they argue they are lean, just because they use the tools applied. Working on the underlying aspects of lean is, therefore, forgotten. Also, the motivation for utilizing lean is vague. When they do not grasp the motivation for utilizing lean, other than that, others have used it, and it was a success on previous projects. It seems like they have not understood the fundamental principles. 

I addition to misinterpretation of lean, the understanding of digital tools is weak. In some cases, the digital tools applied are more a burden for the users than actual help. There are two main explanations for this problem to occure. One is that the tools investigated are for the most used by the managers, directors, and PLs, which tend to be of the older generation. The technical skillset is thus lower than the ones younger. Also, changing from one project to another with all different programs makes it even more difficult. Second, the usability of software applied is often not too good. The focus is more on the functionality of the program, rather than usability. 

Both of these cases fit with the theory of a bottom up approch will be more sufficient securing the use of a certain tool \cite{Robey&Sahay}. While the top-down approach promotes are more broad use of the methodology, and can be sufficient for other projects later on, because the management can take the knowledge, and lessons learnd, and use it later \cite{lean_i_praksis}. 

Contradict to other research where one examine how users react to software improving (for the users) allready known practices \cite{o1999home,svanaes2010usability, nygren1992reading}. The use of Cogito is not. Since Cogito is a tool to support the lean construction and lean design methodology, users not familiar with does do not have the prior context and understanding, which makes it even more difficult to use. 

\section{Unsure resposibility} \label{sec:dis_responsibility}
The LSB-project makes use of a customized contract, named \textit{Totalentreprise med forutg√•ende samspill}. The implications of a new contract have shown to be a more complicated issue than the intention. The intention of the contract was for the contract to support the interaction and prevent errors in the design. Also, considering the project consist of about 30 different contracting firms. The result is a problem in harmonization between the actors, thus leads to difficulty utilization of lean. This argument correlates with the previous research \cite{miller2002harmonization}.

The project seems to have clear role expectations, as Rolfsen promotes\cite{rolfsen}. The results show that even though the project has clear role expectations, it seems like the managers and PLs have problems in decision making. This might suggest that the contractors are up to secure their contracts and increase their revenue. However, based on prior research, one might argue that a more plausible explanation has to do with risk allocation \cite{zaghloul2003construction}. 

The implications of the insecurity lead to delays and reduced utilization of human resources, which again leads to low LP.

\section{Limitations}
This project thesis has the goal of giving a direction for the upcoming master thesis. Even though the research is not to be published, the conduction of the results should be equally good. 

The research question tries to identify answers to a generalized problem. Using a single case-study has the limitation of not providing the generalized answer, the method, though, will give a more in-depth observation of the phenomenon. This approach may answer some of the problems, but not all. Thus, the object observed could have displayed some of the issues, but certaynely not all.

Furthermore, the data used in the analysis is, arguably, too small. This is caused by poor planning, both from the researcher's side, but also, the contact at Statsbygg. When the planned observation was done, the project was at the end of a significant milestone, making for the small number of meetings observed. Also, the contact has been sick leave, which made for problematic planning of interviews. The collection of interviewees does not contain any workers (modelers, engineers, architects, etc.), which makes for a difficult discussion of the top-down approach due to misbalance in data.

Despite these limitations, the findings are still quite substantial. The issues reported are present, and some modifications are needed in the CI. Also, the research question has been answered. The finding can arguably describe some of the reasons for the difference in LP in the ICT-industry and CI. Still, further research is needed to establish a definite truth about the situation.
